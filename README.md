## ⚙️ Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **MATLAB** | R2018a or later recommended |
| **Toolboxes** | Image Processing Toolbox |
| **OS** | Windows / macOS / Linux |

> To verify the Image Processing Toolbox is installed, run in MATLAB:
> ```matlab
> ver('images')
> ```

## 🚀 How to Run

**1. Clone or Download the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ImageProcessor.git
```

Or download the ZIP and extract it.

**2. Open MATLAB and Set the Path**

Launch MATLAB, navigate to the project directory, and add `src/` to the path:

```matlab
cd('path/to/ImageProcessor')
addpath('src')
```

**3. Launch the GUI**

Run directly from the Command Window:

```matlab
ImageProcessor
```

Or open via GUIDE:

```matlab
guide
```
Then go to **File → Open** and select `ImageProcessor.fig`, then press **F5** to run.

**4. Start Processing**

- Click **Load Image** to import an image file
- Browse the available operations from the GUI controls
- Preview results in real time
- Click **Save** to export the processed image

## 📝 Notes

- The `.fig` and `.m` files share the same name (`ImageProcessor`) and **must stay in the same folder** — MATLAB requires this for GUIDE-based GUIs.
- Always run `addpath('src')` before launching the GUI, otherwise the callback functions won't be found.
- MATLAB GUIDE is available up to **R2022b**. In R2023a and later, GUIDE was removed. The project can still be run, but editing the layout requires an older MATLAB version or migration to App Designer.
- Sample images are provided in the `Assets/` folder to test filters immediately after setup.
